<h2>1. About the game in general</h2>
<h2>2. Task - Start building</h2>
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>Build 1 sawmill
<li>Build 1 quarry
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>1. A few words about the user interface</h2>

The game interface can be divided into four main parts:
- Planets (upper left)
- Fleets (under the planets)
- Menus (under the fleets)
- Main screen (the rest of the screen)

Initially you will use the following:
- Planet profile: you can reach it by clicking on the name of a planet
- Messages
- And the chat of course :)

<h2>2. The first build</h2>

As Zandagort is an economic based game so let’s start with some building stuff. First enter to the profile of your planet by clicking on its name in the planet list. There are several tabs on the planet profile page (such as Ecosystem, Economics, War etc.), first you will need only the economics tab.

As you can see there is some basic industry (left column) and stock of resources (right column) on the planet. There are two ways to build a new building:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>To expand an existing industry click on the building name.</li>
<li>If you build a new type of building, select the \"New building\" option at the bottom of the industry column.</li>
</ul>

To build a new building write the amount you wish to build into \"build\" field of the dropdown menu and click on \"build\" or \"build inactive\" option. This time choose the \"build\" option. If you build an inactive structure it will not operate when it is ready, you will have to activate it manually. Now build the following structures:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>1 Sawmill</li>
<li>1 Quarry</li>
</ul>
")
,2=>array('Utilizing the starting stock',"Congratulations! Now you see how you can build. Let's start some serious investments:

<h2>1. Basics of the economy</h2>
<h2>2. Task - Make good use of the starting stocks</h2>
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>Build 80 Villages</li>
<li>Build 70 Wind farms</li>
<li>Build 2 inactive Meat factories</li>
<li>Build 6 inactive Sawmills</li>
<li>Build 4 inactive Quarries </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>1. Basics of the economy</h2>

As the Zandagort is a real time strategy game, the economy has an important role in it. In order to build a strong base of industry you have use the available resources well. At the beginning the most important thing to increase the production of the basic resources: Lumber and Stone. As the experienced top players used to say: you can never have too much stone. These two resources will determine your pace of progression so make sure you always improve their production.

<h2>2. Make good use of the starting stocks</h2>

The idle resources are not working, so it is important to invest all of the available resources into the improvement of your economy. First you should increase the population in order to have more workers. The workforce is the half of the population. After building the villages the growing of the population takes some time so build the industrial building as INACTIVE. As your population grows you can active them. Build the followings:

<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>80 Villages</li>
<li>70 Wind farms</li>
<li>2 inactive Meat factories</li>
<li>6 inactive Sawmills</li>
<li>4 inactive Quarries </li>
</ul>

There is a choice to play with the tech levels: as the 80 villages finish you will reach the Tech 1 level in a few rounds where a more effective power station will be available. This case you do not need to build the wind farms but bioethanol or geothermal power plant (it depends on the planet class which one you can build). After you put them into the list we can talk about the warfare.

,3=>array('Launching a fleet',"Until you factories under construction let's try out fighting.

<h2>1. Task - Launch a fleet</h2>

<li>Approach a pirate fleet</li>
<li>Shoot it down</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. *Bonus Task - Find all the pirates and shoot them down</h2>

<hr />

Beware of the pirates!

Before going anywhere with your ship pay attention to the following: the planets above 2M km2 are defended by NPC fleets owned by pirates. With your initial 1 piece of carrier never attack a planet that has number 4, 6, 8 or 10 next to it, because you have no chance against them! As the planets are not in your range of sight you can not see them, but if you approach closer you will see them with your own eyes.


<h2>1. Task - Launch a fleet</h2>

On the profile page of the planet you can see the \"War\" tab. By clicking on it you can see the spaceships on and above the planet. By default you have 1 carrier. You can launch your ships by writing the amount you wish to launch (currently it is 1) into the field next to the ships then click on the green arrow next to the big empty field right below the list of the ships. If you would like to name your fleet, write the name you like into the field before launching it.

<h2>2. Basics of the warfare and map handling</h2>

As you launch your fleet it appears in the list of stationing fleets on the planet and the list fleets on the left of the screen as well. If you click on the fleets name in any list you can reach the fleet profile page. On the profile you can see the properties of the fleet and you can also issue orders if you know the destination. If not, click on the 'Map' menu or the coordinates of the fleet to enter the galactic map. In the middle you can see your fleet and your planet. The green area around your planet is the territory of the planet. You can zoom in/out with the +/- buttons below the map. You can navigate on the map with the arrows below or simply left clicking on the map into deep space and dragging it while holding down the mouse button.

You can give commands to the fleet by right clicking on it, select a command and then select a target or destination.

<h2>3. Task - Control your fleet</h2>

According to gossip there is a pirate fleet lurking around your planet. Find it and shoot it down.

<h2>4. *Bonus Task - Find all the pirates and shoot them down</h2>

There might be other pirates as well. Find them all and shoot them down. You can get 1000 units of chip as a bounty.
")
,4=>array('Construction queue',"Congratulations! You have reached Tech level 1. You probably got your factories built. As the number of free workforce grows (manpower is always half the population) you can activate your factories.

<h2>1. Construction queue</h2>
<h2>2. Task - Get your first construction queue:</h2>
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>10 Villages</li>
<li>1 Bioethanol power station or 2 Geothermal power plants (depends on your planet's class)</li>

<li>1 Quarry</li>
<li>10 Villages</li>
<li>2 Bioethanol power stations or 2 Geothermal power plants</li>
<li>1 Sawmill</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>1. Construction queue</h2>

Since the game is a real time strategy game the events don't stop even if you aren't at your computer. So in order to avoid putting anybody in disadvantage because they aren't online non-stop, Zandagort has several convenience features. One of the most important ones is the construction queue. So you don't have to log in every hour and start a new building.

Without a premium subscription you can only add 5 lines to your queue, however, with a subscription you can make a limitless list. You've got a 10 day premium as a gift to your registration so now you can make a list of any size. The most rewarding is to imporve your wood and stone industry first so let's make a queue for it. But before we start here are some suggestions about the logics of building which worth to take care of:
The basic resources which you ALWAYS need are: Manpower and Energy.

Manpower is always the half of the population. Since the growing of the population takes a lot of time we should start our list with villages. Let's put on the list some of these:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>10 Villages</li>
</ul>

The next is the energy:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>1 Bioethanol power station or 2 Geothermal power plants (depends on your planet's class)</li>
</ul>

Then build the industry itself:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>1 Quarry</li>
</ul>

Let's repeat with some sawmills but now add some food as well(1 Meat factory/Veg factory/Bakery 20 000 resident, so it provides supplies for 40 Villages):
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>10 Villages</li>
<li>1 Bioethanol power station or 2 Geothermal power plants</li>
<li>1 Meat factory</li>
</ul>

Then following this pattern:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>10 Villages</li>
<li>2 Bioethanol power stations or 2 Geothermal power plants</li>
<li>1 Quarry</li>
</ul>

And finally get some more lumber:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>10 Villages</li>
<li>2 Bioethanol power stations or 2 Geothermal power plants</li>
<li>1 Sawmill</li>
</ul>

Observe as the cost of your building appears above your queue and also appears the number of turns needed to produce them at the current(!) production rate. Try to keep these numbers as close to each other as you can while you assemble your list. The list also adds the needed manpower for you. You can see it next to each of the planned buildings. Villages and cities produce manpower so their need is negative while others are consume it. It's quite useful since you can see whether you have enough villages to maintain the planned industry.

<h2>Some useful relations:</h2>
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>1 meat factory/veg factory/bakery can suplly 40 villages with food</li>
<li>for each quarry you need 8, and for each sawmill you need 4 villages, but it worth to count with a small margin (like 10 and 5 villages)</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Building until the first titanium work</h2>

With the construction queue your eceonomy grows even if you are offline. With some calculation you can scheudule the constructions for 1-2 days ahead and you can enjoy the real life as well :) For now gradually increase your lumber and stone production. You will soon reach Tech level 2 (90 000 residents are needed for it) where you'll be able to build a new factory: the titanium works.

<h2>Until then some advices:</h2>
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>At the beginning you should always have more quarries than sawmills by 1-3 pieces.</li>
<li>If you use a construction queue then try to keep the turns needed for the stone and lumber (somewhat) equal.</li>
<li>Don't forget to produce enough energy and manpower for your industry and food for your residents!</li>
<li>Your population grows the fastest if you have much more habitation and food then needed. So it's worth building more and more village-food factory blocks.</li>

</ul>
<h2>3. About alliances</h2>

<hr />

<h2>1. The first titanium works</h2>

If you have at least 10 sawmills and 12 quarries you can consider to build your first titanium works. Titnium is a very important material for advanced industrial buildings and for spaceship produtcion as well. First it is enough to build only one of it. You do not have to build it as soon as you can, there are players who build 12-13 sawmills and 14-15 quarries before starting the first titanium works as the better lumber/stone production gives a stronger base for the economy improvement.

<h2>2. Task - Build 1 Titanium works</h2>

For titanium works you need much more resources than for anything you built before, so it will take quite a while until you collect all. Besides lumber and stone you need glass too. Even though you cannot produce glass at the moment, you got 20 000 tons at registration that will be enough until you have glass factories.

<h2>3. About alliances</h2>

Zandagort is a multiplayer (MMO) game, so you are not alone in this universe, but with a lot of other people. If you click on CHAT menu, you can see some of them talk. Feel free to say hello.

What is very important: you don't stand much chance alone. There are a couple of reasons for this:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>If you need information (and rookies typically need a lot of information) or (in-game) financial support, you won't get it as a lone wolf. Even though there's no principle against helping anyone, players prefer to help there mates (in their alliances).</li>
<li>If you are alone and have more planets, there's nothing to protect you from being attack except for your own strength. And if your opponent is stronger than you, you can hardly fight back. As a member of an alliance you can protect each other or negotiate non-aggression pacts with other alliances.</li>
<li>One server of the game lasts for 5 months. If you play alone, you will probably get bored/burnt out playing for such a long time. As a member of an alliance it's easier to find some adventures, and there's always someone to entertain you.</li>
<li>At the end of the server Zandagort arrives to destroy the galaxy. That means all the planets, including yours. Based on previous experience the result is partial or total destruction, and lone wolves rarely survive the end game.</li>
</ul>

In the <b>ALLIANCE</b> menu you can see all the alliances ordered by their distance to you. Due to military-geopolitical reasons, alliances are usually organized on territorial basis, so better choose an alliance near your planet. But you can also move (with all the factories you have already built) until you reach Tech level 4 (population of 190 thousand).

If you choose an alliance (pick an \"open\" alliance typeset in bold), click on its name and send an entry application from its profile. If they accept it, you become a member of the alliance. The other option is to write a letter to a leader of the alliance (click on his name and you can send a message from there) and ask for az invitation.

<h2>2. Task - Coal factory</h2>
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>Build 1 Coal factory</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. About power stations</h2>

<hr />

<h2>1. While waiting for the titanium works</h2>

The first titanium work is under construction. During this time you better not sit idle, but raise the number of sawmills and quarries. Before starting glass production, you should have about 20 quarries and 18 sawmills.

<h2>2. Task - Build 1 Coal factory</h2>

Before the titanium work completes you will need a
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>Coal factory</li>
</ul>

The coal is not a building material, it is a transitional material that is required for titanium production. That is why you need only as much coal production as the titanium works requires. The following industries need coal:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>Titanium</li>
<li>Plastic - It will be discussed later</li>
</ul>

The coal factory needs lumber to operate. Its input is 100 m3 lumber per round and it produces 40 tons of coal. The titanium work requires an input of 15 tons of coal and 500 tons of titanium ore and it produces 300 tons of titanium. As you can see 1 coal factory can support more than 2 titanium works so you will not need more of them for now.

<h2>3. About power stations</h2>

As you will reach the 3rd Tech level there will be new power stations available depending on your planet class except class A. If you have class A planet don't panic, Tech level 4 will compensate for everything ;) The new power stations on Tech 3 (and on the later levels as well) are more effective than the wind farm, bioethanol or geothermal power plants but not equally. The best one amongst them is the Osmotic plant on the class D planet, the second best is the Solar power station and then comes the Wave farm and the Tidal power station. For those who got \"more expensive\" power stations: there is nothing to worry about, in exchange your planets have better resources ;) With the Tech 3 power stations you can consider the change of the wind farms by building a few additional power stations and demolishing the wind farms. With the osmothic plant you can even change the bioethanol plants as well.

<h2>1. Glass factory and sand mine</h2>

Now that you have titanium production you can slowly start producing another resource which is glass. Glass is also a complex material so it can be produced from another resource, sand. A sand mine can produce 100 tonns of sand and a glass factory consumes 50 tonns. It's easy to calculate that 1 sand mine can sustain 2 glass factories.

<h2>2. Task - Glass industry</h2>

Before/while building your glass factories it can be handy to build another titanium works. While it's under construction you can start building glass factories and sand mines. Don't forget: 1 sand mine can supply 2 glass factories. Build only as many sand mines as needed for glass production (later you will need sand for chip production, but that's later).

,9=>array('Getting ready for plastic industry',"Soon plastic factories will be available which will play a great role during the whole game. To build this industry you're going to need all of the currently available resources so before you start you should gradually build up a similar system:

<li>38-40 Sawmills</li>
<li>40 Quarries</li>
<li>4 Titanium works</li>
<li>10-12 Glass factories</li>

")
,10=>array('Plastic industry',"You've reached an important point. Plastic is going to be one of the most determining resource next to stone. On the other hand it's the most complex to produce, it's manufactured as follows:

Lumber >> Coal >> Oil >> Plastic

The coal factory consumes 100m3 lumber and produces 40 t coal. The oil factory consumes 100 tonns of coal while producing 400 barrels of oil. Finally the plastic factory consumes 200 barrels of oil and produces 10 tonns of plastic. This may look like chaos for first. For greater transparency we should think in the following units during cunstructions:

5 Sawmills >> 10 Coal factories >> 4 Oil factories >> 8 Plastic factories

With your current production capacity this would took much time in a whole so if you're using a build queue you should divide it to smaller pieces. Since you'll need the least from oil factories it's the best to have one of them in each piece. Somehow like this (of course you're going to need villages, generators and food factories between them):
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>2 Sawmills</li>
<li>3 Coal factories</li>

,11=>array('Chip industry',"Soon you'll have enough plastic to construct your first chip factory. With this we've reached the last letter that contains relatively concrete construction instructions since you can take more ways from now on. So you will only get advice natured descriptions.

Chips are needed for the most advanced buildings sucs as teleports, research labs, or shipyards. For the operation of the chip factory you need qualified workers as well. Qualified workers are produced by cities, one of them houses 5000 of these people. You need 500 qualified workers in order to operate 1 chip factory, so it's currently enough for 10 chip factories.

For the first city it's adviced to have at least 5 chip factories and 1-2 teleports as soon as you can construct them, for which you need qualified manpower as well. From now on the different styles separate, you have several choices:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>If you keep improving your chip and plastic production then you get the base of a trade or military eceonomy. (However it won't worth to produce many ships until 4 or 5 planets.)</li>
<li>If you stop at 5 chip factories and build some research labs then you can take the way of a stable constructer/producer eceonomy.</li>
<li>It is worth to look at your planet's class.</li>

,12=>array('More about teleports',"You can sell your resources on the exchange or send it to another one of your planets (if you'll have more) by using teleports. In every case you'll need them in only the sender side, so the planet where you send or sell. For example if you would like to purchase some resources after selling others you won't need any teleports on the planet where you need them. (Of course if you accidentally bought the resources on a planet where you don't need them then you'll need some teleports to transfer them to the correct destination.

<h2>Transfering resources to another planet:</h2>
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>You can arrange this from the planet's profile under the \"Transfer\" tab. You can see the teleport's charge rates counted in TC. For sending type in the required amount next to the appropriate resource then click the green arrow next to the target planet on the bottom. You can send more kinds of resources but only to owned planets.</li>
<li>When giving an amount you can use shortcuts as well so you don't get lost between hundreds of zeroes:<ul class=\"classic_lista\">

,13=>array('Tech level 5',"Congratulations! You have reached tech level 5. New buildings available:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>HDR plant</li>
<li>Research lab</li>
<li>Enrichment plant</li>
<li>Shipyard</li>
<li>Intelligence HQ</li>
<li>Nuclear power plant</li>
</ul>

Almost all buildings in the game are available for you. There's no one-way strategy from now on, so you get some tips for each building.

<h2>HDR plant</h2>
One of the best power plants you can build without research. It is very effective and cheap. You should consider swapping your existing power plants with HDRs. It means you should demolish your older power plants and replace them with HDRs. Be careful not to run out of energy during the process.

<h2>Research lab</h2>
Research labs have two major functions:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>Producing research points</li>
<li>Exploration of raw materials and ores</li>
</ul>

A research lab can do only one of these at a time, but you can change between them any time. You can use research points to develop technologies (required for better power plants and spaceships) or to decrease the footprint of buildings (you won't need this now).

Exploration of raw materials and ores gets very important when stocks run out. Each ore can be explored with twice efficiency on a specific planet class, so you better explore them accordingly.

<h2>Enrichment plant</h2>
You will need enriched uranium for the following buildings:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>Shipyard</li>
<li>Nuclear power plant</li>
<li>Space station</li>
</ul>

The biggest consumer of these is the shipyard. One shipyard uses 300 pellets of enriched uranium per round, so you need 30 enrichment plants for continuous operation. So you better not start producing ships in large quantities right now, because you don't have to industrial capacity required.

<h2>Shipyard</h2>
And we've reached the point that so many of you waited for :) You can conquer planets by using ships, attack other players, or defend yourself from their attacks. Be careful ! Starting a war is expensive and risky, like it always was during the history of mankind. A very important advice: it's only worth to build shipyards on planets with at least 800 defense points. Basically you can go on two different ways, however, both have lots of shades:
1. You're glad of your shipyard and keep constructing your industry. Since building ships is a quite expensive activity it can really hold you back in progression. Of you choose the peaceful way you only construct inactive shipyards, maybe even multiple of what you can supply. This won't hold you back in progression but you won't have an army either. On the other hand you can quickly produce one if you're attacked by anyone.
2. Improve you titanium, chip, and uranium industry and start to manufacture ships. Remember, unused ships are just like unused resources. It's only worth producing in bigger quantities if you use it.

<h2>Intelligence HQ</h2>
The training of agents takes place here. You can gather information about other players, empires, planets, or even sabotate them with your agents. For the operation of intelligence HQs you need qualified manpower for which you need cities. Their orders must be payed with SHY, so you should have some trading background as well.

<h2>Nuclear power plant</h2>
Advanced and effective power station. In order to construct one of these you have to research nuclear fission, for which you need 500 research points. Experience has shown that it's worth to take the money and time to develop them as fast as possible.


<h2>Conquering a second planet</h2>
Soon after reaching Tech 5 you'll be able to conquer your second planet (exactly at 350 000 population). You should construct a basic wood-, stone- and titanium industry first just like you did on your first planet. Start with something like this:
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>40 Sawmills</li>
<li>60 Quarries</li>
<li>5 Titanium works</li>
<li>4 Teleoprts</li>
</ul>

And of course the needed power stations, manpower, and food industry for the population.

<h2>Some advice:</h2>
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>Build shipyards only on planets above 800 defense points, if possible</li>
<li>Keep most of your plastic industry on your starting planet initially</li>
</ul>

,14=>array('Tech level 6',"You have reached the highest tech level. Don't think that you can stop here, the real excitements are just starting :) Firstly some words about the new buildings.
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>Distillery: produces alcoholic beverages, it's sole purpose is to supply space stations.</li>
<li>Space station: has two functions. Firstly it supplies your ships' crew with alcohol, improving their morale. On the other hand it provides a radar with 500 parsec range for you planet.</li>
<li>SPS: the solar power plant's orbital version. Extremly effective, buildable on every planet. In order to construct these you have to research nuclear fission first, then microwave power transmission. You need qualified manpower to operate them.</li>
<li>Fusion power plant: The most effective power station in the game. It has very high research requiements, but it's worth to develop them sooner or later.</li>
</ul>

Some final advice which you should take into count, or at least consider. You might read some of them in the previous letter, but remember: repetition makes the master :)
<ul class=\"classic_lista\">
<li>Build shipyards only on planets above 800 defense points, if possible.</li>
<li>Always have some spare inactivated shipyards. It takes lots of time to construct one and you don't always have it.</li>
<li>Plastic industry isn't planet-type-dependent, so it's worth to place most of it on defended planets.</li>
<li>Until you don't have at least one from all kinds of planets try to conquer a class that you don't have yet.</li>
<li>Try to explore every resource on the appropriate planet. Just count it: for producing the same amount of raw resoure/ore you need half of the labs and cities! This isn't a negligible saving.</li>
</ul>
